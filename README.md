# Park O' Meter
Park O' Meter is an Android application (italian language only) used to calculate the amount of money needed to pay for the park: just add the price (hourly rate) and the start and ending times.
It also allow to save presets of car parks so you don't have to insert the hourly rate each use.

## Technical info
Park O' Meter support Android 5.0+, mostly because of the use of some material styles, but it will be backported to Android 4.* soon.
Presets are saved using Realm instead of SQLite

## TBD (see [Issues](https://github.com/davideserafini/Park-O-Meter/issues)): 
- cool UI
- launcher icon and logo
- better error handling for times
- extend support to non-material devices (pre Lollipop)
- publish to the Play Store
